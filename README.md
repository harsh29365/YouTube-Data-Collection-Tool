Of course! Here is a comprehensive and well-structured README file for the provided Python script.

YouTube Channel Video Data Exporter

This Python script utilizes the YouTube Data API v3 to fetch comprehensive data for all videos from a specified YouTube channel. It first collects all video IDs from the channel's "uploads" playlist and then retrieves detailed statistics and metadata for each video. Finally, it exports the consolidated data into a videos.csv file.

Features

Automated Data Collection: Fetches data for every public video on a channel.

Comprehensive Details: Gathers key metrics including titles, view counts, like counts, upload dates, video duration, and thumbnail URLs.

Efficient Processing: Uses batching to retrieve video details efficiently, making 50-video requests at a time to respect API best practices.

User-Friendly Feedback: Displays progress bars (tqdm) for both video ID collection and detail fetching, so you know the script is working.

Secure Configuration: Uses a .env file to securely store your API key and channel ID, keeping them out of the source code.

CSV Export: Outputs the data into a clean, ready-to-use CSV file (videos.csv) for easy analysis in Excel, Google Sheets, or with data analysis libraries like Pandas.

Prerequisites

Before you can run this script, you will need:

Python 3: Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system.

Google Cloud Project: A project with the YouTube Data API v3 enabled. You can create one on the Google Cloud Console.

YouTube API Key: An API key generated from your Google Cloud Project.

Channel ID: The ID of the YouTube channel you want to analyze (e.g., UC...).

Installation

Clone the repository (or download the script):

code
Bash
download
content_copy
expand_less

git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name

Install the required Python packages:
It's recommended to use a virtual environment.

code
Bash
download
content_copy
expand_less
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END
# Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

If you don't have a requirements.txt file, you can create one with the following content or install the packages manually:

requirements.txt:

code

python-dotenv

Manual installation:

code
Bash
download
content_copy
expand_less
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END
pip install google-api-python-client pandas tqdm python-dotenv

Create the environment file:
Create a file named .env in the same directory as the script and add your credentials:

code
Env
download
content_copy
expand_less
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END
# .env file
YOUTUBE_DATA_API="your_api_key_here"
CHANNEL_ID="the_youtube_channel_id_here"

Replace the placeholder values with your actual API key and the target channel ID.

Usage

Once the setup is complete, simply run the script from your terminal:

code
Bash
download
content_copy
expand_less
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END
python your_script_name.py

The script will display its progress as it fetches data:

Output

The script will generate a file named videos.csv in the root directory. This file contains the data for all videos from the specified channel, with the following columns:

Column	Description	Example
title	The title of the video.	"My Trip to the Mountains"
likes	The number of likes the video has received.	15023
views	The total number of views for the video.	850123
upload_date	The date and time the video was published (in ISO 8601 format).	"2023-10-26T14:30:00Z"
duration	The duration of the video in ISO 8601 format.	"PT10M35S" (10 minutes, 35 seconds)
thumbnail_url	The URL of the video's default thumbnail image.	"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/videoID/default.jpg"
Important Notes

API Quotas: The YouTube Data API has a daily quota (typically 10,000 units per day for a new project). This script makes multiple API calls. A playlistItems.list request costs 1 unit, and a videos.list request costs 1 unit. Be mindful of your usage, especially on channels with thousands of videos.

Error Handling: The script includes basic error handling but may fail if the API key is invalid or the channel ID is incorrect.

Private/Deleted Videos: This script will only fetch public videos. Private or deleted videos will not appear in the results.
